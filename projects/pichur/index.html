				<p class="description">Pichur (pronounced Pi-CH-ur) gives Windows users something they've been wanting
				 for a while: a native photobooth application.</p>
				 <p class="description">Pichur meets the needs of any computer user looking for such an application: it's fun, 
				 fast, stable, and very easy to use. Go ahead and look at more cool things Pichur can do below, but it'd 
				 probably be quicker to just go ahead and download it by clicking the button to the right. :)</p>
