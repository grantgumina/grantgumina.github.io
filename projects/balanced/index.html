                    <p><i>Balanced is an attempt to build software that helps people make sense of an increasingly polarized and interconnected world.</i></p>
                    <p><i>When you install the Balanced Chrome extension, you’ll be exposed to different opinions on various topics as you consume your daily news. If you’re reading an article from Salon about ISIS, Balanced will recommend you read one from Breitbart. If you’re reading something written about a proposed carbon tax from CNN, Balanced will recommend you read an article written by the Wall Street Journal.</i></p>
                    <p><i>As more and more people are spending their time in tailored experiences designed to get them to react in ways that don’t take into account anything other than some Key Performance Indicators a Product Manager spec’ed out, it’s critical we regain these skills else we risk tearing society apart.</i></p>
                    <p><i>Balanced is still in it’s very early stages, so expect to encounter some bugs as you use it. Currently, Balanced only knows about articles from a small set of news sources and won’t be able to provide recommendations for breaking news. More information about all of that can be found below.</i></p>
