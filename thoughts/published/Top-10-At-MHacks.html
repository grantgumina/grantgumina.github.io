<h2>Top 10 @ MHacks</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 07 Feb 2013 00:32:22</strong></p>
<p>This past weekend I attended MHacks - the nation&#8217;s largest student-run hackathon. It was 36 hours of non-stopped (quite literally) coding, and quite possibly more fun than a human being should be allowed to have. </p>
<p>Making the experience even more fun was the fact that my team earned a spot in the top 10.</p>
<p>Earning the top 10 spot was no easy task, so I thought I&#8217;d jot down a few thoughts about what I think got us there and some advice/observations for n00bs.</p>
<h3>Make Decisions Early</h3>
<p>Going into the hackathon, we knew that by the end of it we&#8217;d be exhausted both physically and mentally, so we made a commitment as a team to make important decisions as early as possible when we were at our best.</p>
<p>For example, once we got the idea for our app (<a href="http://grantgumina.com/moments/">Moments</a>) we sat down as a team and wrote down the keywords we wanted our app to be associated with. We talked about how we wanted the app to feel, look, and we outlined the experiences the user should have. In other words, we made all important product branding decisions early on. This document served as a solid foundation when we started to feel the effects of not sleeping (hour 30 for me).</p>
<h3>Delegate</h3>
<p>This is actually something our team really did not do well. Originally we did not plan on making an iOS app, so our team was more geared towards building a web app. However, we did make things work. Since our team was quite large (5 people including myself), we split up as much work as possible. </p>
<p>Unfortunately only one team member was fluent in iOS development, and to no fault of his own, he was a bottleneck for the majority of the hackathon. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend anyone going to a hackathon to have a team full of generalists, or have a very good idea of what type of application you want to build.</p>
<h3>Macs Rock</h3>
<p>As much as I hate to say this, especially because I&#8217;m working at Microsoft this summer, I will admit the Macbook is the perfect hackathon machine. Basically having a workable Unix distro that can run Photoshop is a killer, unless you&#8217;re comfortable building a hack on a Windows/MS-based stack.</p>
<h3>Actually Sleep</h3>
<p>While it may be fun at first to try to outlast the guys on your team, it&#8217;s a good idea to get sick. I wish I had because as I&#8217;m writing this I&#8217;m suffering from a cold I contracted over the course of the hackathon.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about it, but I think I&#8217;ll make revisions to this document as I think of them.</p></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
