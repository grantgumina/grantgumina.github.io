<h2>Being a Microsoftie!</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Sun, 16 Jun 2013 00:08:00</strong></p>
<p>So it&#8217;s my fourth week here at Microsoft for my summer internship as a Program Manager Intern, and I&#8217;m absolutely blown away by what an amazing opportunity I have here. I work in Office with the division that manages updates/service packs to Office customers, however my team actually doesn&#8217;t do any of that work. Instead, we focus on ensuring Microsoft is meeting it&#8217;s anti-trust agreement obligations in various markets.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m most impressed with so far is the fact that everyone I&#8217;ve interacted with here has been incredibly smart, motivated, and goal driven. Perhaps it&#8217;s the nature of the work our department does, but I&#8217;m shocked at how well organized and structured things are at Microsoft. Honestly, I think the company deserves a lot more credit than it gets for doing something that&#8217;s perceived to be simple (pushing out an update to Office for example) than it does. Remember, there are millions of Office customers than span hundreds of different markets. So for each bug fix that happens or new feature that makes it&#8217;s way into the build, it must pass a series of tests that ensure it meets geopolitical, cultural, and legal requirements for each market.</p>
<p>For example, say a new feature is added and as a part of the feature a popup appears when an error is handled. Now imagine if inside the popup there&#8217;s an image of a hand inside a stop sign. Guess what? That feature can&#8217;t be sold to middle eastern markets because it doesn&#8217;t meet the cultural requirements Microsoft has set in place (the hand motioning &#8220;stop" is an offensive gesture in Middle Eastern cultures).</p>
<p>The point is that Microsoft does a LOT of amazing things that most normal people simply aren&#8217;t aware of because if they were, then Microsoft would have screwed up! Another really quick example is Internet Explorer. Many web developers (myself included) complain that IE is slow to supporting the latest web technologies. Well that&#8217;s an unfortunate fact, but it turns out there&#8217;s a good reason for it. Talking with an intern on the iE team I was told that IE intentionally doesn&#8217;t support the bleeding edge technologies for security reasons. IE is used by millions of businesses as their web browser, and if just one of those bleeding edge standards introduced by WC3 isn&#8217;t implemented properly there could be a massive security problem spanning millions of customers in thousands of industries. Do you really want to risk that when the major financial institutions are running Microsoft software?</p>
<p>Like I said, I&#8217;m blown away by how awesome the people are here and how they&#8217;ve solved so many complicated logistics issues. I&#8217;m looking forward to working on the team for the rest of the summer and help solve some really interesting problems.</p></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
