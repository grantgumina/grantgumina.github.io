<h2>Being Present</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 02 Aug 2012 23:33:00</strong></p>
<p>Thoughts about being an active participant, refusing to be a professional spectator, and doing something worthwhile.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s said that my generation is the &#8220;activist generation". Sociologists and historians even say that my generation is the most willing to take up arms against an injustice, be active in a cause, and have (in general) an attitude that we can make things better. Generally, the narrative is that since my generation has instantaneous and unregulated access to the Internet we are able to communicate and organize events with previously unseen easy and spontaneity.</p>
<p>This ability allows us to organize street protests when we suspect police injustice or corruption in government. It allows us to flood our congressmen with emails and phone calls when they upset us. We even organize boycotts against large corporations with hopes to thwart plans.</p>
<p>But with all this &#8220;activism" what&#8217;s really been accomplished? The more skeptical side of me says that all my generation has done is remain passive about meaningful issues and make a lot of noise when ever something upsets us. And I&#8217;ll go even further and argue that many times what upsets us is ourselves when we realize our own hypocrisy.</p>
<p>For example, we might &#8220;passionately" argue that child labor is wrong, but go on buying products from companies who openly use child labor. So when we realize this we must find a way to live with ourselves. The healthy, and moral, way would be to either re-evaluate our position on child labor or correct our behavior. However, we often just seek an escape. A release valve so to speak. We do things like buy Fair Trade USA coffee, donate to a cause, or even more commonly nowadays we sign an online petition &#8220;demanding" action be taken. The reality is that we still are hypocrites and we still will have to face ourselves, but the immediate sensation of being confronted with yourself has been diverted.</p>
<p>This is what I will call being a spectator. A spectator is someone who isn&#8217;t involved. Someone who doesn&#8217;t have their hands dirty in the nit-and-gritty workings of the world. It&#8217;s someone who takes the easy way out and does something to make themselves feel better instead of doing the hard thing which would require them to actually spend time and energy making the world a better place.</p>
<p>Today, the sad reality is that we&#8217;re not an &#8220;activist generation", we&#8217;re a spectator generation. Take a look at tech &#8220;journalism" for example. You have entire websites, with full time staff, setup to commentate on technology (primarily consumer electronics). These people&#8217;s jobs are to report, review, and speculate about all consumer electronics. Every time there&#8217;s an Apple product announcement, they&#8217;re there live blogging the event. They create an atmosphere of sensationalism and frenzy that rivals the World Cup.</p>
<p>Sadly, these commentators are followed by millions of tech-obsessed observers and consumers who salivate thinking about the increased processor speeds in the latest smartphone or, who are enthralled about the speculation regarding a new product. Have we really, as a society, come to the point where every six months we need something new? Are we so dissatisfied with our lives that we feel compelled to become enthralled with these meaningless things instead of doing something worthwhile? Why do we need to escape like that?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s even worse is that many of these &#8220;tech celebrities" have commentators who comment on their commenting. Yeah for real. So, for those of us who are seriously obsessed and bored, there&#8217;s an opportunity to become involved with the ever present, always ongoing, soap opera of tech &#8220;journalism". Not only do we follow Scoble, but we follow the ten tech bloggers who devote so much of their time and energy commentating on what he says, making fun of his opinions and antics, or even (ironically) bitching about his obsessive and sensational tendencies. </p>
<p>There does seem to be a small faction of people on the Internet who actually make things, however I don&#8217;t view what they make to have much importance in our world. They&#8217;re the type of people who think they can save the world with their web app or iPhone app. They can&#8217;t think any bigger than their own immediate context and cultures, and consequently ignore the systemic injustices or problems that plauge the systems they are trying to fix. Hence they think they can cure world hunger with a smartphone app or jump-start the American economy with hundreds of thousands of crowd sourced projects.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t think any bigger than this because they&#8217;re a spectator. They don&#8217;t have the capacity to think bigger because they&#8217;ve bought into the idea that their Fair Trade coffee purchases actually mean that they give a shit about kids in Africa.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t we think bigger? Why can&#8217;t we face ourselves and live radical, consistent lives according to our beliefs? Why can&#8217;t we take that attitude and use it to build things that matter? Let&#8217;s stop building nonsense. Let&#8217;s stop trying to save the economy through arts-and-crafts projects. Let&#8217;s stop trying to cure world hunger with an iPhone. Let&#8217;s build things that matter. Let&#8217;s jump-start the economy by building engines that get 200mpg. Let&#8217;s cure world hunger by genetically engineering plants. Let&#8217;s stop blogging about Apple&#8217;s latest iProduct and spend more time investigating the root of our society&#8217;s ills. Let&#8217;s even decide to throw in a little good and inspiring news every once-in-a-while! Let&#8217;s stop being spectators and start being present.</p></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
