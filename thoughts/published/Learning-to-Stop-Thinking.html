<h2>Learning to Stop Thinking</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:19:00</strong></p>
<p>Most of my family members can attest to the fact that for my entire life I've had trouble winding down and just sitting still. This was especially true when I was younger and it was time for me to go to bed. I remember spending a good two or three extra hours each night drawing, reading, or just thinking in general after I was ...tucked in&#8220;.</p>
<p>Since then, that extra time each night hasn't really gone away. To this day I spend an hour or two each night writing, drawing, or just thinking about things in general. In today's soci Business Review the second from The Acton Institute) about defining and obtaining what you believe ety this might be considered anti-social or abnormal behavior, but I personally cherish this time.</p>
<p>As I've grown older what I've thought about after ...tuck in&#8220; has grown and matured as well. It's gone from having conversations about politics with my dad in elementary school to reflecting on Nietzsche after graduation. However, recently, this year I've found the need to stop thinking.</p>
<p>Before this semester I hated inconsistencies or paradoxes and generally didn't believe in them only the need for better explanations. This holds true for the most part to this day. However, I have found that there is a time when the only sane thing to do is set aside rationality and presuppositions and emerge yourself in doubt and confusion. Lingering in it may be bad and harmful, but embracing it and not fearing it is the proper thing to do. When you do that all sorts of interesting possibilities start to emerge.</p>
<p>I've seen that when you make sense of everything, quantify everything, convince yourself all possibilities have been explored, and put people into boxes you lose the wonderful experience of daily whimsy and fun. You end up being so right that you're a terribly miserable person who will always let yourself down and allow yourself to be let down by others. </p>
<p>What I haven't figured out, however, is if you can have both? Can you make sense of the world, have absolutes and certainty, and yet still find beauty and whimsy in day-to-day life? Does beauty have to be intriguing? Or is beauty supposed to be intriguing and are you supposed to be able to accept you don't know everything? Is that the beauty? Finding peace and rest among doubt and uncertainty?</p></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
