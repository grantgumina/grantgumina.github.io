<h2>The First Product I Ever Shipped</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Sat, 16 Mar 2013 00:17:00</strong></p>
<p>If you asked me what I wanted to be when I was nine, I would have told you I wanted to be a Computer Engineer. Fueled by the fact that when I was younger my family didn&#8217;t own a computer (in fact to this day my parents have never bought a computer of their own), my curiosity towards computers grew the more exposure I had to them.</p>
<p>Eventually I earned enough money from the lawn service business I started in Middle School to buy my own laptop before entering High School (funny side note - I remember agonizing over whether to buy a laptop or a desktop  - that was a major decision just a few years back!). Over time, the same entrepreneurial spirit that made me realize I could make money mowing people&#8217;s lawns, led me to the revelation that the software I wrote could go beyond silly games or using AppleScript to make my mom&#8217;s iBook say naughty words. It could, in fact, actually help people.</p>
<p>The first program I made that was actually useful to someone, in other words the first product I ever shipped, was a super simple and rudimentary punch card application. Written in C# with WinForms, my punch card application (now forever lost to the ether), was designed because my dad (who at the time was managing a bike shop) constantly complained about having to manually enter his employee&#8217;s time cards into an Excel worksheet. My program allowed employees to punch in, out, and then neatly exported the results to an Excel worksheet.</p>
<p>At the time I knew enough to realize what I had built was not a professional solution, and in fact I didn&#8217;t try to persuade my father to use it because I had very little confidence in my code. However, looking back on it, I&#8217;m actually impressed that my 14 year old self (with very little experience other than writing the simple Hello World programs and a basic guessing game) was able to pull off something like I did.</p>
<p>Even though I lost the executable, I still have basic sketches of the UI and workflow that I drew in my &#8220;idea book" (a big blue artist sketchbook a family friend gave to me) for the program. Somehow, as a 14 year old, I envisioned this program to be run on a touchscreen computer, so I made the buttons large. On the margins of the sketches, I wrote down how many &#8220;clicks" it took a user to get something done. Hilariously, since I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to make a window change it&#8217;s UI, and instead had to resort to opening a new window for each screen I wanted to create, I scribbled down how that was a major constraint and how it was forcing me to simplify things even more!</p>
<p>I hope that in the future, I&#8217;ll be able to look back and see the trend of learning continue. I hope to one day laugh and look back at how little I know now, but still be proud of the work I did.</p></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
