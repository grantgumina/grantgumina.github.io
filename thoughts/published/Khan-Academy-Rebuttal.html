<h2>English Paper - Khan Academy Rebuttal</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 12 Jul 2012 08:17:00</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to bring up the topic of education reform without bringing up the Khan Academy. This online ...school&#8220; is a website that uploads instructional videos about subject matter ranging from linear algebra to venture capital and economics. Currently, over a million ...students&#8220; are registered on the website.</p>
<p>This popularity has inspired website like the Singularity Hub to publish an article proclaiming, ...The Khan Academy is the best thing that has happened to education since Socrates.&#8220; The author argues this because of the Khan Academy's ability to offer lessons for free to anyone in the world.</p>
<p>While this may sound attractive at face value, especially considering the current need for affordable education and high quality students, when these ideas are explored a little deeper major problems arise. The author makes the major, and erroneous, assumption that a traditional education experience (i.e. one that takes place in a physical classroom setting) can be replicated and improved upon with an education consisting solely of the Khan Academy's instructional videos. Upon further reflection and contemplation, it becomes evident that the Khan Academy will not reform the education system in any meaningful way as it does not encourage students to master material, neglects the importance of relationships in education, and promotes ...groupthink&#8220; on a global level. For these reasons, the Khan Academy may be the most dangerous phenomenon happening to education in society today.</p>
<p>The author claims that the Khan Academy's videos are at the same quality level as a professional educator's lectures. They're not. Not one of the Khan Academy's staff has any background in teaching; instead they're mainly from finance and engineering backgrounds. Furthermore, the Khan Academy's videos simply show students the mechanics of doing a problem, not necessarily why they're doing the problem. In other words, the Khan Academy only promotes a superficial understanding of material instead of a deep and rich education offered by traditional institutions.</p>
<p>Another factor the author neglects is the importance of social growth and exploration built into the traditional education system and impossible to replicate online. Abundant social interactions are important in a student's education because they foster meaningful relationships, and encourage a student to think about ideas from a broad range of perspectives. The traditional educational setting provides an ideal environment for this where students from all disciplines interact with each other. More importantly, are the personal relationships students can develop with professors and teachers. These relationships will encourage students to push themselves to new limits and explore new possibilities.</p>
<p>Lastly, the author claims that the Khan Academy could be used as a standardized global curriculum. The advantages, he argues is that there would finally be a meaningful ranking system for students worldwide. Once again, the author fails to see the bigger picture. The beauty of the education system is that it promotes new ideas among students. A global standard system would promote ...groupthink&#8220; where students worldwide would be taught the exactsame thing and look at things from the exact same perspective. This would be detrimental to innovation and progress.</p>
<p>While the Khan Academy is not a panacea for all education-related problems, there is still hope for the future. The majority of the educational problems can be solved with a re-prioritization of society's goals. Mainly, educators need to stop focusing so much on standardized testing and instead shift their focus towards individual student's needs. Educators of the future need to choose to build meaningful relationships with their students by investing time in their lives. With this additional investment, students will grow into dynamic and inspired individuals capable of enacting positive change in the world in which they live.</p>
<p>The problem of education is serious and complex. It is a problem that cannot be solved with a quick fix, and instead has to be solved a reprioritization of goals. Consequently, a website like that Khan Academy won't change anything. Change can only be brought about by refocusing education on developing a student's understanding of material, providing students with opportunities to make meaningful relationships, and teach them how to think for themselves. Only this kind of reform will produce meaningful change.</p></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
