<h2>Back to the Desktop</h2>
<p><strong>Posted 9/13/2013 4:13:42 PM</strong></p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In the Fall of 2010, Apple had their "Back to the Mac" event where Steve Jobs &amp; Co. announced OS X Lion among other things. The name of the event was chosen not just for how easily it rolled off the tongue, but because the company realized it had neglected to bring much innovation to their desktop operating system while they were making great strides on iOS.</p>
<p>Fast-forwarding to the present, we can see a similar situation with Windows. An incredible amount of progress has been made with Windows 8 and the Modern UI, and there's been an equally impressive amount of progress made with Windows Phone. However, it's interesting that many of the innovations made on the mobile front haven't trickled their way into the desktop like they have in OS X.</p>
<p>Obvious changes would be to have OS wide search integrated with Bing (which in all fairness is coming to 8.1), removing all Save buttons in favor of auto-save, or updating the Win32/WPF Windows controls to look similar to what you see in Modern apps. However less obvious changes, and arguably more important changes, can be made to enhance user's productivity and creativity.</p>
<p>The modern desktop user interface revolves around the file manager where users open, save, and navigate to all of their content. However, the process of actually <em>managing</em> your files hasn't actually changed much since we first saw the desktop paradigm gain popularity in the 1980s. You still have to manually name files, organize them in directories, and delete them when/if they become irrelevant. For some reason we put up with this on our desktops, but not on our tablets/mobile phones.</p>
<p>For example, whether you're in Windows, OS X, or some version of Linux, creating a file inside of a file manager looks the same. You right click, select new on the context menu that pops up, and maybe even select the file type from another context menu. So why does it take so many steps to create a file? If the file manager were such a central part of the mobile OS experience, then such an important interaction wouldn't be hidden like it is now.</p>
<p>Below is a reimagining of existing file managers presented as several use cases and how a modern file manager should handle them.</p>
<h3>Creating a New File</h3>
<p>Everyone has experienced creating a directory for a project or class or subject in school they're working on expecting that project/class/subject to be something they do once and never do again. Rarely do they consider the possibility that whatever they're doing may span multiple years or semesters. Let's say you join a club on your college campus called the "Humanitarian Society" and upon obtaining an exec board position with the club you create a directory somewhere on your computer called, logically enough, "HS". As the semester progresses, you write letters to various companies and organizations asking for donations.</p>
<p>Let's say you're trying to recruit Acme Explosives to sponsor your club's next event and you need to write a letter to the company's executives asking for money. In a modern file browser, you'd create a new file, the file would automatically get the proper extension, any content that could be generated automatically by the file manager would be (in this case  and the default editor for that file type would open.</p>
<p>Inside the editor you see that the letterhead is the same as your previous letters, all your contact information has been filled in (including the new address you moved to since the last time you wrote a sponsorship request), and there's even some generic boilerplate text based on previous letters.</p>
<p>Once you start editing and making the letter specific to Acme Explosives, the file manager is able to detect those changes and name the file accordingly. The end result is a file inside a directory where all the filenames all follow a generic template ("CompanyX-Sponsorship-Letter.docx" for example).</p>
<h3>Adding Granularity</h3>
<p>Now let's say that a new school year has begun and you're still with the Humanitarian Society serving on the exec board. Well guess what? You have to write letters to sponsors again! So you go to your HS directory and create a new folder. The file manager notices that you haven't had much interaction with the HS directory since last semester (Spring of 2013) and suggests that the new folder be called "Fall-2013". After you confirm this choice, the folder Fall-2013 is created, but so is another folder - "Spring-2013" - where all your documents that used to be in the root of HS now reside. If you had documents from the Fall of 2012, then a folder for that semester would also be created.</p>
<h3>Dynamic Granularity</h3>
<p>By automatically adding folders and moving files to directories based on the time the file was created, the file manager is adding granularity to the file system. So instead of having a mess of files inside a folder's root, the files are nicely organized. However, what if we want to organize the files by content or subject instead of by time?</p>
<p>Well imagine the file manager making suggestions of how to organize files. As a user, you would click a button and the folder would organize files by something other than time. The subdirectory names and contents would all change to reflect your choice.</p>
<h3>Folders and Tags</h3>
<p>Much of what I've talked about above could be accomplished by creating a file manager that displays files and hierarchy by tags. This is true, however it's important to remember that  a system which uses tags exclusively doesn't actually have any structure or organization to content - only the illusion of organization. In fairness, those illusions are also and advantage as it allows file managers to present information in new and unique ways such as displaying all files at once and color coding labels, for example. </p>
<p>The solution is to develop a file manager which treats directories as tags - something that makes perfect sense if you assume directories will follow logical naming conventions. The benefit to the user is that the file manager can display their files in ways which the traditional root/subdirectory structure can't - such as allowing users to perform operations on files that do not exist inside their current directory.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think that the time is right for major innovations to happen on the desktop which has gotten left behind in terms of features and usability since the tech industry really started to focus on mobile experiences. However, it's time for the industry to shift focus once again to the desktop and take what it's learned about UX while building mobile devices/experiences and apply that to the desktop.</p></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
