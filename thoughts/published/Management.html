<h2>Management</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Thu, 27 Jun 2013 00:22:00</strong></p>
<p>July will be my second sprint here at Microsoft, and things are about to get cranked up a notch (or seven). You see, in our next sprint my feature crew will be implementing what I&#8217;ve been designing and prototyping since I got here, and as the PM I&#8217;ll be the one driving/managing that process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve written code and design products that have shipped to customers before, but up until this point I haven&#8217;t been solely responsible for a product&#8217;s design or launch before - it&#8217;s always been a collaborative effort. I think my challenges I&#8217;ll face are going to be primarily with planning. I&#8217;ve always worked by myself or with just one other person in the past, so I didn&#8217;t have to worry too much about the day-to-day activities of the team.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll set weekly goals so we don&#8217;t get lost in the sprint. I can easily see that happening, especially as an intern where one week seems to just roll right into another and it&#8217;s hard to keep track of my schedule + 2-3 others. I&#8217;ve also setup two times a week to have a &#8220;feature crew sync" (each being 30 minutes long) where we can hash out any issues that have come up and make sure we&#8217;re on track to meet our weekly goal.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m honestly hoping that we&#8217;re communicating enough throughout the week that my twice a week feature crew meetings will be (relatively) unnecessary. I wish we would all stand during these meetings though. An advantage of having people stand is everyone will be (quite literally) on their toes - they&#8217;ll be alert and paying attention at all times. They won&#8217;t have a chance to respond to an email on their laptop or a chance to lean back and tune out. Instead, their focus will be on the topic at hand. Lastly, and maybe this is because I&#8217;m a Jack White fan, but I think being comfortable kills creativity and drive. Tension is always a good when building things.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m going to de-emphasize the feature crew&#8217;s spec quite a bit. I think it&#8217;s silly (especially in a team transitioning to agile) to put so much initial overhead into investigation and planning without actually building or prototyping something simultaneously. Instead, I&#8217;m going to have design drive my spec(s) now and in the future.</p>
<p>For example, after getting assigned to a feature crew I&#8217;ll start (like I did for my current FC) by interviewing users and talking with them. This will correspond with my spec&#8217;s Overview/Justification/Goals sections. Next, I&#8217;ll just start creating mockups ASAP - maybe even showing them to users. I did this for my current FC, but I need to be quicker with this process. Where I failed was that I&#8217;d design entire workflows all dependent on a few assumptions that&#8217;d be blown away once my feature crew met. This process was too costly because our meetings weren&#8217;t frequent enough and I never got any initial feedback from users. In the future, I&#8217;ll be iterating (weekly or more) with the FC and perhaps a user (provided enough has changed in the UI/workflow from the previous iteration) with my mockups. I also think I&#8217;ll save creating the Design portions of the spec until much later on in the process because it&#8217;s a hassle to re-write things when my mockups can change so fast.</p>
<p>So moving forward I&#8217;m going to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spend minimal time planning - instead focus on building and shipping</li>
<li>Deal with issues quickly as they come up and adjust accordingly</li>
<li>Keep constant contact with my team so we can render most FC syncs obsolete</li>
<li>Let design drive my spec</li>
</ol></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
