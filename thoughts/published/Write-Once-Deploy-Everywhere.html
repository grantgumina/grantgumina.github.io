<p>[Write Once. Deploy Everywhere.]
<strong>Posted Fri, 15 Mar 2013 02:35:00</strong></p>
<p>Due to a major feeling of exhaustion and a severe lack of funds, I decided not to join my fellow classmates on their escapades and adventures to Panama City Beach and instead stayed home. So to make things interesting, I decided I&#8217;d take Microsoft up on their <a href="http://build.windowsstore.com/keepthecash#fbid=vB1X-a08UcG">Keep The Cash</a> program and at least reduce my cashflow problem.</p>
<p>Originally, I was going to attempt to build an app a day, but I wasn&#8217;t well versed in the new Windows 8/Windows Phone 8 ecosystem to do that. Instead I made three apps in about five days. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>What was amazing however, was my experience porting my Windows 8 app Resistur to Windows Phone 8 (<a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/search?q=resistur">link to final product here</a>). For the Windows 8 version, I built a custom XAML control using Expression Blend, and made it be able to dynamically link to another UI element with Microsoft&#8217;s databinding API. In the Windows 8 version&#8217;s case, the custom control was bound to a textbox in a two-way fashion. So when the textbox was updated, the control would also update and vice versa.</p>
<p>When I first started to write the Windows Phone 8 version of Resistur, I tried not to think about rewriting the custom control used in the Windows 8 version. Oh how I remembered the hours I spent dealing with graphical glitches, responsiveness issues, and all the other intricate issues that come with custom XAML controls. To my surprise, however, I found that the custom control I wrote for Windows 8 could be ported over to Windows Phone 8 with minimal changes to the code base.</p>
<p>In fact, I think I spent a total of half an hour porting over the code (with the exception of the two hours it took me to figure out a namespace issue I was having - turns out the XAML standards for Win8 and WP8 aren&#8217;t very very very similar, but not the same)&#8230;</p>
<p>This experience got me thinking about something I&#8217;ve been saying for a while now, and something that I think the entire tech industry is getting ready to happen; the ability to write one executable, and have it deployed across a myriad of devices and screen sizes. In other words, the ability to &#8220;write once, deploy everywhere".</p>
<p>As a developer, I think the platform that offers this ability would be very attractive to me. Even if it didn&#8217;t have a lot of marketshare <em>cough</em> Windows 8/WP8 <em>cough</em>, the ability to spend the time building an app and having it available to multiple platforms/users would be enormous. In Microsoft&#8217;s case, it might even compensate for the relatively small marketshare Win8 and WP8 currently has.</p>
<p>But the real way to sweeten the deal? Somehow, magically, get the Xbox to share some of the Windows codebase. Write once, deploy to PC, phone, and livingroom. That&#8217;s a totally immersive experience, and one that no one has gotten right yet.</p></div></div><!-- Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster --><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery-1.8.0.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tooltip.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-alert.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-button.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-carousel.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-collapse.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-dropdown.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-modal.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-popover.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-scrollspy.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-tab.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-transition.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/bootstrap-typeahead.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.validate.unobtrusive.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="docs/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js"></script></body></html>
