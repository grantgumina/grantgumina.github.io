<h2>The End of Nostalgia</h2>
<p><strong>Posted Monday, 2 Sep 2013</strong></p>
<p>I was thinking about the new campus bike my dad and I built for me to use here at Purdue, and in the process of hacking together a workaround to save me the $50 required to buy a singulator (stupid vertical dropouts) he came across an old '78 Campy derailleur he hadn't seen in a couple of decades. All of a sudden I was bombarded by a whole slew of technical details, stories about when and where he bought it, what races it had been in, etc., etc. The most interesting part of the conversation, however one sided it may have been, was that even after 35 <em>years</em>, my dad thought that derailleur was the coolest thing in the world and insisted I use it on my campus bike.</p>
<p>It was interesting to me that discovering the derailleur resulted in an enormous amount of nostalgia for my dad, but more importantly that nostalgia was almost <em>more nostalgic</em> because that derailleur was <em>still useful</em>. I realized that, something that's old, has intrinsic value to the one who possesses it, and can still be useful in the present is more nostalgic and valuable than something that's obsolete.</p>
<p>To convince yourself of this point, think about how when you buy a new computer or television, it loses it's value by hundreds of dollars the instant you buy it. Or how about going on Craigslist and browsing the electronics section. Look at how many &lt; 2 year old t.v.'s there are on Craigslist and how low little they cost.</p>
<p>Things that are high tech, I'm thinking of electronics primarily but I'm sure other types of devices exist, simply won't ever have nostalgia because the environment these devices are created in is one of faced paced innovation where a new model or technology renders everything before it obsolete.</p>
<p>So while you may be able to go to the Computer History Museum and see a VAX 11/780 from Digital Equipment Corporation, you'll only be able to look on in awe and admiration for the engineers who built the machine. You'll never be able to say anything to the equivalent of "this is so much smoother than the new stuff" or "The way this derailleur shifts is <em>superior</em> to what we have now". </p>
<p>As more elements of our lives become digital and connected to the cloud, I don't see how nostalgia will continue to exist. Personally, I think that's a bad thing, but it's not inconceivable that society will invent new mechanisms to achieve the same positive benefits nostalgia has. </p>
<p>Importantly, however, the challenge here is not to figure out ways to preserve nostalgia or build technology differently. Instead it is figuring out how to produce societal innovations as fast as technological ones.</p>
