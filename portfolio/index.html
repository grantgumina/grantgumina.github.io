						<strong>Moments</strong>
						(2012)
						<p>An anti-social photo sharing iPhone app created at MHacks I which placed in the <strong>top ten hacks</strong> a the event.</p>
						<p>With Moments, users captured moments via their iPhone camera, wrote a message about that moment then released the moment to the public. When another user walked in the vicinity of this picture, they'd get a notification and be able to view that moment. After a user viewed a Moment, that Moment would be gone forever. </p>
						<p>My team's goal with Moments was to get people to embrace the ephemeral nature of life by rejecting the traditional social media user's unhealthy obsession with saving, sharing, capturing, and compulsive checking of content.</p>

						<strong>The FIRST Alliance</strong>

						<p>From 2011 to 2012, The FIRST Alliance was the FIRST Robotics Competition's premier website for statistics about FRC teams.</p>

						<p>Our focus on developers was a huge contributor to our success, but the killer feature really was our user accounts. With their account, FRC members, coaches, and parents got an interactive dashboard for statistics and updates of their favorite teams.</p>
						<p>During the peak of it's popularity, TFA recieved <strong>2,000 hits per hour during competitions</strong>.</p>
						<p>Although not maintained anymore, you can still view TFA <a href="http://thefirstalliance.org">here</a>.</p>
