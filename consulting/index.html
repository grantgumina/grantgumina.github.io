							<h3>Lead Generation like Never Before</h3>
						</header>
						<p>A year ago I was Director of the world's largest student-run co-working space, The Anvil, at Purdue University. While fundraising, I learned that colleges and universities across America all have the same problem. They all have lists with thousands of graduates, but they have no idea what those graduates are doing today or how to target their personal interests to illicit donations and support.</p>
						<p>Over the course of a year, drawing on my experience at Purdue, I've developed a method assisted by computer algorithms to identify potential leads based on interests and activity in industry. So far it's been implemented at The Anvil, but also recently the Purdue Research Foundation with great success.</p>
						<p>While the goal is to grow this to encompass many types of industries, I'm focusing on generating leads who are interested in startups, entrepreneurship, and investing. I can generate a list of leads who are CEOs, founders, or investors as well as work with you to develop a strategy and programming to engage them.</p>

							<h3>Algorithmic Lead Generation</h3>
							<p>Part magic. Part finely tuned machine. I spent the past year at Purdue as Director of the <a href="http://anvilstartups.com">world's largest student-run co-working space</a> and developed a rock solid lead generation system that's finally ready for primetime.</p>
